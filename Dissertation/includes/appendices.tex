\chapter{Running the Programs}
An example of running from the command line is as follows:
\begin{verbatim}
      > java MaxClique BBMC1 brock200_1.clq 14400
\end{verbatim}
This will apply $BBMC$ with $style = 1$ to the first brock200 DIMACS instance allowing 14400 seconds of cpu time.

\chapter{Generating Random Graphs}
\label{sec:randomGraph}
We generate Erd\'{o}s-R\"{e}nyi random graphs $G(n,p)$ where $n$ is the number of vertices and
each edge is included in the graph with probability $p$ independent from every other edge. It produces
a random graph in DIMACS format with vertices numbered 1 to $n$ inclusive. It can be run from the command line as follows to produce
a clq file
\begin{verbatim}
      > java RandomGraph 100 0.9 > 100-90-00.clq
\end{verbatim}
