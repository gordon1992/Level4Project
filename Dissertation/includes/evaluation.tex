\section{Devices Used}

For the purposes of evaluating the performance of both the scorer and the scorer
and parser, a Mac Pro (Early 2008 - MacPro3,1) was used. This was fitted with
two Intel Xeon E5462 processors, and a nVidia Tesla C2075 GPU. In addition,
there was a separate machine fitted with an Intel Xeon Phi 51100P. A brief
overview of the hardware will be given to provide some perspective to the
results which follow.

\subsection{Mac Pro System}

The Mac Pro was running Mac OS X version 10.8.5 (Build Version 12F45). Both the
nVidia and Intel OpenCL SDKs were installed and up to date at time of writing.

\begin{itemize}

\item[CPU] The motherboard has two CPU sockets, both with an Intel Xeon E5462
\footnote{\url{http://ark.intel.com/products/33084/Intel-Xeon-Processor-E5462
-12M-Cache-2_80-GHz-1600-MHz-FSB}} processor. This is a quad core processor with
a 2.8GHz clock speed and 12MB of Level 2 cache per processor.

\item[RAM] There is 14GB of PC2-6400 (800MHz) DDR2 RAM installed, with error
correcting code (ECC) enabled.

\item[GPU] The GPU is an nVidia Tesla C2075
\footnote{\url{http://www.nvidia.co.uk/docs/IO/43395/NV-DS-Tesla-C2075.pdf}}.
The device has 6GB of dedicated GDDR5 memory running at 1.5GHz giving an
internal memory bandwidth of 144GB/s. There are 448 ``CUDA Cores'' with a clock
frequency of 1.15GHz. It has been installed in a PCIe 1.0 slot with 16x lane
bandwidth giving a total theoretical bandwidth between its on-board memory and
main memory of 4GB/s (250MB/s per lane).

\end{itemize}

\subsection{Intel Xeon Phi System}

\begin{itemize}

\item[CPU] There is a single Intel Xeon E5-2620
\footnote{\url{http://ark.intel.com/products/64594/intel-xeon-processor-e5-2620
-15m-cache-2_00-ghz-7_20-gts-intel-qpi}} fitted. This is a six core processor
with hyper-threading to give twelve hardware threads. The standard clock
frequency is 2GHz with a maximum turbo frequency of 2.5Ghz. There is a total of
15MB ``Intel Smart Cache'' available which acts as Level 3 cache.

\item[RAM] 16GB DDR3 RAM

\item[Intel Xeon Phi] The Intel Xeon Phi is the 51100P
\footnote{\url{http://ark.intel.com/products/71992/intel-xeon-phi-coprocessor-
5110p-8gb-1_053-ghz-60-core}} variant. There are sixty physical CPU cores
running at 1.053GHz, the cores are 4-way hyper-threaded resulting in 240
hardware threads. There is 8GB of on board memory running at 5GT/s for a
theoretical maximum memory bandwidth of 320GB/s. It has been installed in a PCIe
2.0 slot with 16x lane bandwidth giving a total theoretical bandwidth between
its on-board memory and main memory of 8GB/s (500MB/ per lane).

\end{itemize}
