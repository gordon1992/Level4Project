\section{Devices Used}

For the purposes of evaluating the performance of both the scorer and the scorer
and parser, a Mac Pro (Early 2008 - MacPro3,1) was used. This was fitted with
two Intel Xeon E5462 processors, and a nVidia Tesla C2075 GPU. In addition,
there was a separate machine fitted with an Intel Xeon Phi 51100P. A brief
overview of the hardware will be given to provide some perspective to the
results which follow.

\subsection{Mac Pro System}

The Mac Pro was running Mac OS X version 10.8.5 (Build Version 12F45). Both the
nVidia and Intel OpenCL SDKs were installed and up to date at time of writing.

\begin{itemize}

\item[CPU] The motherboard has two CPU sockets, both with an Intel Xeon E5462
processor. This is a quad core processor with a 2.8GHz clock speed and 12MB of
Level 2 cache per processor.

\item[RAM] There is 14GB of PC2-6400 (800MHz) DDR2 RAM installed, with error
correcting code (ECC) enabled.

\item[GPU] The GPU is an nVidia Tesla C2075. The device has 6GB of dedicated
GDDR5 memory running at 1.5GHz giving an internal memory bandwidth of 144GB/s.
There are 448 ``CUDA Cores'' with a clock frequency of 1.15GHz. It has been
fitted into a PCIe 1.0 slot with 16x lane bandwidth giving a total theoretical
bandwidth between it's VRAM and main memory of 4GB/s (250MB/s per lane).

\end{itemize}

\subsection{Intel Xeon Phi System}

\begin{itemize}

\item[CPU] There is a single Intel Xeon E5-2620 fitted. This is a six core
processor with hyper-threading to give twelve hardware threads. The standard
clock frequency is 2GHz with a maximum turbo frequency of 2.5Ghz. There is a
total of 15MB ``Intel Smart Cache'' available.

\item[RAM] 16GB RAM

\item[Intel Xeon Phi] Intel Xeon Phi 51100P

\end{itemize}

\section{Scoring-only}

Scoring only results. Results averaged over the 12 profiles after 10 repetitions
each.

20, Bloom Filter and Bloom Filter No Hits is 23, and Bloom Filter No Hits is 22.
