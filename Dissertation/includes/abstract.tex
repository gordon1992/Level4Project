Document filtering is problem of growing importance. The advent of the Internet
has resulted in a massive surge in the transfer and storage of data and
information. A prime example is email where hundreds of billions are sent every
day. Emails, and other kinds of documents, require to be filtered. This problem
is highly data parallel in nature as the classification of one document does
not affect the classification of another. This report investigates the viability
of using GPUs rather than CPUs for the classification. GPUs are designed with
parallel problems in mind and thus have the potential to allow for significantly
higher throughput compared with CPUs.
