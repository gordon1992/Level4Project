Document filtering is a problem of growing importance. The growth of the
Internet has resulted in a massive surge in the transfer and storage of data and
information. A prime example is email where hundreds of billions of messages
are sent every day. Emails, and other kinds of documents, can sometimes need to
be filtered. This problem is highly data parallel in nature as the
classification of one document does not affect the classification of another.
This report investigates the viability of using GPUs rather than CPUs for the
classification. GPUs are designed with parallel problems in mind and thus have
the potential to allow for significantly higher throughput compared with CPUs.

The results show that GPUs can classify documents from a solid state drive or a
15Gbit/s Ethernet network feed in real-time. In future work, investigations of
performance scaling with multiple consumer class GPUs will be conducted, with
the aim of being able to parse and score documents from a 100Gbit/s Ethernet
link.
