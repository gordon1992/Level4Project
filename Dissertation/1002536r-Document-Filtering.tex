\title{GPU-Accelerated Document Filtering}

\begin{abstract}
Document filtering is problem of growing importance. The advent of the Internet
has resulted in a massive surge in the transfer and storage of data and
information. A prime example is email where hundreds of billions are sent every
day. Emails, and other kinds of documents, require to be filtered. This problem
is highly data parallel in nature as the classification of one document does
not affect the classification of another. This report investigates the viability
of using GPUs rather than CPUs for the classification. GPUs are designed with
parallel problems in mind and thus have the potential to allow for significantly
higher throughput compared with CPUs.

The results show that...

\chapter{Introduction}
\pagenumbering{arabic}
The first page, abstract and table of contents are numbered using Roman numerals. From now on pages are numbered
using Arabic numerals. Therefore, immediately after the first call to $\backslash$chapter we need the call
$\backslash$pagenumbering$\{$arabic$\}$ and this should be called once only in the document.

The first Chapter should then be on page 1. You are allowed 50 pages for a 30 credit project and 35 pages for a
20 credit report. This includes everything up to but excluding the appendices and bibliograph, i.e. this is a limit on
the body of the report.

You are not allowed to alter text size (it is currently 11pt) neither are you allowed to alter the margins.

Note that in this example, and some of the others, you need to execute the following commands the first time you process the files.
Multiple calls to pdflatex are required to resolve references to labels and citations. The file bib.bib is the bibliography file.

\chapter{Running the Programs}
An example of running from the command line is as follows:
\begin{verbatim}
      > java MaxClique BBMC1 brock200_1.clq 14400
\end{verbatim}
This will apply $BBMC$ with $style = 1$ to the first brock200 DIMACS instance allowing 14400 seconds of cpu time.

\chapter{Generating Random Graphs}
\label{sec:randomGraph}
We generate Erd\'{o}s-R\"{e}nyi random graphs $G(n,p)$ where $n$ is the number of vertices and
each edge is included in the graph with probability $p$ independent from every other edge. It produces
a random graph in DIMACS format with vertices numbered 1 to $n$ inclusive. It can be run from the command line as follows to produce
a clq file
\begin{verbatim}
      > java RandomGraph 100 0.9 > 100-90-00.clq
\end{verbatim}
